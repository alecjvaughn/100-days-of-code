# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 1, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on setting up Python env in VS Code and web-scraping.

**Thoughts** Got stuck while setting up environment, workaround using Terminal. Exciting to see my first official web-scrape!

### Day 2: November 2, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Python env and added a local file to scrape data from.

**Thoughts** It is expedient that I fix the env in VS Code so I can make use of the debugger. One hour is not enough to code and do research and debug. Maybe plan a sprint?
