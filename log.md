# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 1, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on setting up Python env in VS Code and web-scraping.

**Thoughts** Got stuck while setting up environment, workaround using Terminal. Exciting to see my first official web-scrape!

### Day 2: November 2, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Python env and added a local file to scrape data from.

**Thoughts** It is expedient that I fix the env in VS Code so I can make use of the debugger. One hour is not enough to code and do research and debug. Maybe plan a sprint?

### Day 3: November 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Can debug in Py env. Scraping local file now and storing sushi rolls by ingredient in dict.

**Thoughts** Not many lines of code written yet. Lots of testing.

### Day 6: November 8, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a dev branch and added some regex and string manipulations to the class that didn't work.

**Thoughts** I am glad I used the opportunity to push to a different branch rather than break main. Will require a makeup day next Saturday to make up for last Friday Nov 6.
